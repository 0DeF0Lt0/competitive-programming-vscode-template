# Competitive Programming Template for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
A Competitive Programming setup for C++, Java, Python languages on Visual Studio Code. After spending 5-7 days trying to setup Visual Studio Code for Competitive Programming, I have come up with this template for competitive coding.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the folder in **Visual Studio Code**
3. Choose the language of your choice
4. Add the input to **input.txt** file.
5. Run the code!
6. Output will be generated in **output.txt** file

## Points to remember
1. All the three files **main.cpp**, **Main.java**, **main.py** contain a template code which first accepts the number of testcases and calls a function **solve()** where you can write your code.
2. If the input format is different from this one, please make necessary changes to the **main()** function.

## Contributions
All contributions are welcomed through issue tracker and pull requests.
- Please feel free to create issues if you are facing some errors while running the sample templates. I spent a lot of time fixing things so hopefully I can help you resolve them :)
- If you find better header functions our better IO techniques, do contribute!
- If you can add language templates for other languages, do contribute!
